        <p class="profile-detail">
          I am Denine Guy, born and raised in Philadelphia, PA but I currently
          reside in New York City. I hold a BA in Materials Engineering and MBA
          in Marketing and Operations Information Management. I have spent
          several years in technology consulting, the retail sector, and now
          works as a programmer, but my dream is to work as a wed developer in
          ecommerce company, eventually becoming a high ranking executive for a
          major ecommerce company/brand.  Beyond my professional career, I enjoy
          spending  my time traveling, and working with running and crossfit and
          engaging in retail therapy whenever time permits. I consider myself a
          foodie who enjoy trying new restaurants and experience different
          cuisines.
